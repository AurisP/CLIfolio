### 👋 Hi, I’m Auris!

I'm a **software developer** currently based in **Tallinn, Estonia**. I graduated *with honors* from **TalTech University**,  
specializing in Hardware and Software Development. My main focus is on **embedded Linux systems**, working extensively with  
C, Rust, and Java to build reliable and efficient solutions.

🧑‍💻 **Passionate About Learning**  
Both at work and in my personal time, I'm always exploring new technologies. In fact, this terminal application was built using  
**Go** and **Charm** libraries — two technologies I dove into just for the fun of learning something new!

🏃‍♂️ **Sports**  
When I'm not coding, you can find me pushing my limits through full-distance triathlons and ultra-marathons. These endurance  
sports challenge me physically and mentally, offering a whole new way to explore self-discipline and resilience.

🌲 **Hiking**  
I love long-distance hikes in remote, untouched areas. Getting off the grid and reconnecting with nature helps me recharge,  
giving me fresh perspectives that inspire both my life and work.

Feel free to reach out—I'm always open to connecting and discussing all things tech, endurance sports, and the outdoors!
